I tried every trick in the book. But Facebook kept shoving my homepage image down the crawler's throat instead of my dynamic OG image. Deployment after deployment. Nothing changed. That's when the doubt crept in. Maybe I was too old for this. Maybe the machine had finally won. But I wasn't ready to raise the white flag. I can still stand against the machine.

Then, at 4 AM, while staring at the screen with bloodshot eyes, I finally saw it. The rooster crowed outside my window. And in that moment, I realized the truth: I was using 'use client' at the top of my page. Facebook's crawler doesn't execute JavaScript. It only reads the initial HTML response. All those beautiful meta tags? They only appeared after React hydrated. The crawler saw an empty shell. No og:image. No og:title. Nothing.",

The moment I deployed, Facebook finally saw the correct image. The lesson is brutal but essential: Always check your actual page source (Ctrl+U), not just the Elements tab. If your meta tags aren't in the initial HTML, crawlers will never see them. Server Components for SEO. Client Components for interactivity. Don't learn this the hard way like I did. And if your tandem says 'it's gonna work' for the hundredth time? Maybe listen to the rooster instead.",
